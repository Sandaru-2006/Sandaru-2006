Hi there! 👋
I'm Sandaru, a developer who loves diving into code and occasionally stumbling onto solutions that actually work. I’m all about learning, experimenting, and building projects that make the web a bit more functional.

What you'll find here:
🌐 Web projects: From small apps to full-stack experiments, I enjoy crafting applications that aim to be practical and efficient.
🔧 Ongoing work: Constantly working on new ideas (and fixing the bugs in my old ones—no judgment here).
🛠️ Tech stack: Mostly working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask, and figuring out why my code sometimes has a mind of its own.

A bit about me:
I’m always on the lookout for new tools and techniques, hoping to improve my skills and create something that others find useful. When I’m not coding, I’m probably thinking about coding... or rewatching one of my favorite movies for the 10th time.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub! Feel free to check out my projects, and if you spot any bugs, just pretend they’re hidden features. 😉
